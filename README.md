# Features
   * An FLS velocity model consisting of adjustable acceleration, deceleration, and speed parameters.
   * Two FLS failure models:  RandTTL using a uniform distribution and BetaTTL using a skewed distribution.
   * Fix-sized reliability groups consisting of G illuminating FLSs and 1 standby FLSs.
   * Mean Time to Illuminate a Dark (MTID) point after an illuminating FLS fails.  Visualize results by generating png files in `./assets/figures`.
   * Both illuminating and standby FLSs may fail either mid-flight to their destination or once at their destination.
   * A configurable simulation model to quantify the Quality of Illumination (QoI) as a function of time for a point cloud.  Each FLS is modeled as a process.  With large point cloudes (FLSs), the simulator scales horizontally to run across multiple servers.
   * Detection of obstructing dark standby FLSs.
   * Two techniques to eliminate dark standby FLSs from obstructing the user field of view:  Dissolve and Suspend.
   * Visualizes results by providing a histogram of the group sizes, box plot of distance from the center of a group to the group members, average distance from a dispatcher to group centroid

# Limitations
   * In general, a reliability group may consist of C standby FLSs.  The current implmentation supports C=1 only.
   * We consider the field of view of only one user.

# Clone
``git clone https://github.com/flslab/FailureHandling.git``

# Running using Venv
This software was implemented and tested using Python 3.9.0.

We recommend using PyCharm, enabling the software to run across mutliple operating systems, e.g., Windows, MacOS, etc.

Use the `bash setup_venv.sh` to create and activate a virtual environment or alternatively follow these steps to set it up manually.
First create a virtual environment using venv. 
You can use any name instead of env.

```
cd StandbyFLSs
python3.9 -m venv env
```

Then, activate the virtual environment.

```
source env/bin/activate
```

On windows use the following instead:

```
env/Scripts/activate.bat //In CMD
env/Scripts/Activate.ps1 //In Powershel
```

You can deactivate the virtual environment by running `deactivate` in the terminal.


## Set Up Local
Run ``bash setup.sh`` to set up everything.

If anything went wrong with the bash command, simply run ``pip3 install -r requirements.txt`` in the root directory. If you are using IDE like PyCharm, you can download all the requirements with it.
We recommend the use of PyCharm for running this software on a single laptop or server for evaluation purposes.
By installing and using PyCharm, the single server version of software will execute on a wide range of operating systems ranging from macOS to Windows.  


# MTID
The program `./utils/cmp_shape.py` implements analytical models to compute the MTID for a collection of 3D point clouds (shapes) with different reliability groups.  The reliability groups may be computed using an algorithms such as k-Means or CANF.  More formally, `./utils/cmp_shape.py` assumes:
   * A text file that describes the 3D coordinates of a point cloud.  We provide several point clouds in `./assets/pointcloud`: dragon.txt, hat.txt, and skateboard.txt.  The variable `shapes` defines the point clouds that the program iterates.
   * A .xlsx file that describes a reliability group computed for a shape using a grouping algorithm with a pre-specified group size.  The name of a file is [shape]\_[grouping algorithm]\_[group size].xlsx.  `shape` is from the previous bullet, a user specified identifier for a grouping algorithm, e.g., `K` for k-Means, a value for group size, e.g., 3.  In `./assets/pointcloud`, we provide files for the alternative shapes of the previous bullet, K-Means and CANF, and group sizes of {3, 5, 10, 20}.  These files were computed separately and placed in the `./assets/pointcloud` for use by `./utils/cmp_shape.py`.  This ensures computation of MTID is independent of an algorithm that computes a reliability group. 

The output of executing `./utils/cmp_shape.py` includes:
   * `./assets/mtid_report.csv` contains the minimum, median, and maximum MTID.  It also computes other essential stats such as the minimum, median, and maximum distance of a standby at the center of a group to each group member. This information is reported for each shape, grouping algorithm, and group size.  This is a row of `./assets/mtid_report.csv` file.
   * `./assets/figures` contains a listing of figures for the different shapes, grouping algorithms, and group sizes.  These figures show MTID, a histogram of group sizes constructed by a grouping algorithm, among others.


## Run Local

The variables specified in ``config.py`` control settings. Once these are adjusted (see below), run:

``python3 primary.py``

After the notification "INFO - Waiting for secondary nodes to connect" shows, run:

``python3 secondary.py``

Need to notice that the result output path is also an adjustable configuration.

## Set Up and Run on Cloud Lab
First, set up a cluster of servers. Creat a cloudlab profile using the file ``profile.py``, then start your own experiments with any chosen type of nodes. 
Ideally, the total number of cores of the servers should equal or be greater than the number of points in the point cloud (number of FLSs).
Otherwise, the lack of cores may cause incorrect results. Normally, when the accessible resource is limited, one core for 2 to 4 points will also work. 
 
After setting up cloudlab, modify the following files based on comment:

* ``gen_conf_cluster``: Identify the path where the gen_conf.py lies
* ``cloudlab_vars.sh``ï¼š set the number of nodes 
* ``constants.py``: Set broadcast address and port

Change the configuration for experiments in `gen_conf.py`, this will be the base script to generate configure for each experiment.
Once it's settle, checkout the number of total configurations, and change the number in the For Loop to `the total configuration sets - 1`.
The system will traverse all these configuration sets.

Finally, modify the script `decentralized_gen.sh` following the comment just like previous files. Then run the script to clone the
project and setup on cloudlab (See section above).

Run ``bash setup.sh`` to set up the project.

After all above are done, run `bash nohup_run.sh` on the primary node (node with index 0). Use `tail -f my.log` to trace output in the root directory.

To stop the running process, run the `sudo pkill python3` command in `decentralized_gen.sh`, then run `nohup_kill.sh` on
the primary node.

## Experiment Report

The final report will be generated in a folder named with the experiment configuration, under the result path directory.
A report will include 3 data sheets:
 * Metrics
 * Config
 * Dispatcher

The Metric sheet includes all the reporting information, detailed description shown blown:

## Analytical Models
The movement of FLSs are calculated using the velocity model. We suppose all FLSs have the same maximum speed, maximum acceleration and deceleration.
FLS will start from a speed of 0, and will always accelerate to a max speed if it can.
When an FLS is approaching its destination, it will decelerate with max deceleration and come to a halt at its destination.
The velocity model can be found in ``./velocity.py``.
An FLS's moving time and **MTID** (Mean time to illuminate a dark point due to FLS failure) is calculated using this model.

Once a reliability group is constructed, there will be a group centroid for standby FLS. The average distance from a group centroid 
to a group member is calculated using the average value of distances of all points to their group centroid.
The Average MTID reported were calculated using the average value of the time for a standby FLS/newly deployed FLS to recover a failed illuminating FLS.
Each of these time is the time traveled for an FLS to arrive at the illuminating point.

The Script to compare the MTID of two group formation techniques: CANF and k-means can be found in `./util/cmp_shape.py`.
By specifying variables: `shapes, max_speed, max_acceleration, max_deceleration, disp_cell_size`, the report will be generated in `./assets/mtid_report.csv`.

## Detect Obstructing Standby FLSs
Standby FLSs show remain dark while waiting to recover failed FLSs. Thus, it may block some other illuminating FLSs and diminish the user's immersive experience.
We assume that the user's eye position can be tracked by some tracker mounted on the user's body/head. 
With all these information, we considered the user's eye gaze as a ray, and calculate the obstructing FLSs based on the ray-box-intersection method.

### Obstructing FLS **Detection**
To run a detection, run ``./utils/obstructing_detection.py``.
Specify the configuration and shapes to check in the file, instructions can be found in comments.

The output can be found in ``./assets/obstructing/``, based on your setting, there will be a directories generated.
The result will report the number of visible illuminating FLSs and obstructing standby FLSs if the user look from the {front, back, top, bottom, left, right}, total 6 views.

To solve obstruction detected from a view, run ``solve_obstructing.py`` to move FLSs back. 
The obstructing standby FLS will replace the illuminating FLS that it was blocking, and become an illuminating FLS.
The previous blocked illuminating FLS will move back, hide behind the new illuminating FLS, and become a standby FLS, replacing the previous obstructing FLS.
FLSs may travel a certain distance, the report file will report the distance traveled by the obstructing FLS and illuminating FLS;
the initial distance between the obstructing FLS and illuminating FLS;
number of obstructing FLSs blocking a single illuminating FLS;
the original and new standby FLS's position to the center of the group that they were assigned with;
the original and new MTID for a failure in the group recovered by standby FLSs.
The report can be found in  ``./assets/obstructing/Q{illumination cell to display cell ratio}``

To solve obstruction detected from all views as a whole process, run ``move_back_all_views.py``.
Starting from the first view, obstructing standby FLSs detected from this view will be moved back, then those detected from the next view.
Do this for all six views, and report same metrics as previous.


### Obstructing FLS **Prevention**
To run a detection, run ``./utils/obstructing_prevention.py``.
Specify the configuration and shapes to check in the file, instructions can be found in comments.

The output can be found in ``./assets/obstructing/``, based on your setting, there will be directories generated.
The result will report the number of obstructing FLSs user will see if the user walk around the shape (as a circle), centering the center of the shape. 
Each time, the user will walk and the vector pointing from the center of the shape toward the user's eye will form a {granularity} degree angle with the previous one.

After recording all obstructing information, those obstructing FLSs will look for closest illuminating FLS, and hide inside its illumination cell (if Q > 3).
