# Standby FLSs for FLS Illumination

## Python Version
This software was developed based on Python 3.9.0

## Clone
``git clone https://github.com/flslab/FailureHandling.git``

## Set Up Local
Run ``pip3 install -r requirements.txt`` in the root directory. If you are using IDE like PyCharm, you can download all the requirements with it.

## Run Local

The variables specified in ``config.py`` control settings. Once these are adjusted (see below), run:

``python3 primary.py``

After the notification "INFO - Waiting for secondary nodes to connect" shows, run:

`python3 secondary.py`

Need to notice that the result output path is also an adjustable configuration.

## Set Up and Run on Cloud Lab
First, set up a cluster of servers. Creat a cloudlab profile using the file ``profile.py``, then start your own experiments with any chosen type of nodes. 
Ideally, the total number of cores of the servers should equal or be greater than the number of points in the point cloud (number of FLSs).
Otherwise, the lack of cores may cause incorrect results. Normally, when the accessible resource is limited, one core for 2 to 4 points will also work. 
 
After setting up cloudlab, modify the following files based on comment:

* ``gen_conf_cluster``: Identify the path where the gen_conf.py lies
* ``cloudlab_vars.sh``ï¼š set the number of nodes 
* ``constants.py``: Set broadcast address and port

Change the configuration for experiments in `gen_conf.py`, this will be the base script to generate configure for each experiment.
Once it's settle, checkout the number of total configurations, and change the number in the For Loop to `the total configuration sets - 1`.
The system will traverse all these configuration sets.

Finally, modify the script `decentralized_gen.sh` following the comment just like previous files. Then run the script to clone the
project and setup on cloudlab (See section above).

Run ``bash setup.sh`` to set up the project.

After all above are done, run `bash nohup_run.sh` on the primary node (node with index 0). Use `tail -f my.log` to trace output in the root directory.

To stop the running process, run the `sudo pkill python3` command in `decentralized_gen.sh`, then run `nohup_kill.sh` on
the primary node.

## Experiment Report

The final report will be generated in a folder named with the experiment configuration, under the result path directory.
A report will include 3 data sheets:
 * Metrics
 * Config
 * Dispatcher

The Metric sheet includes all the reporting information, detailed description shown blown:

The Dispatcher sheet includes all information gathered by the primary node. 
In a Dronevision/FLS Display context, this should be the information from the orchestrator.

## Analytical Models
The movement of FLSs are calculated using the velocity model. We suppose all FLSs have the same maximum speed, maximum acceleration and deceleration.
An FLS's moving time and MTID (Mean time to illuminate a dark point due to FLS failure) is calculated using this model.

Once a reliability group is constructed, there will be a group centroid for standby FLS. The average distance from a group centroid 
to a group member is calculated using the average value of distances of all points to their group centroid.
The Average MTID reported were calculated using the average value of the time for a standby FLS/newly deployed FLS to recover a failed illuminating FLS.
Each of these time is the time traveled for an FLS to arrive at the illuminating point.

The Script to compare two group formation techniques: CANF and k-means can be found in `./util/cmp_shape.py`.
By specifying variables: `shapes, max_speed, max_acceleration, max_deceleration, disp_cell_size`, the report will be generated in `./assets/mtid_report.csv`.
